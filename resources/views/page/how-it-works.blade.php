            <p>SendTins connects people who need to send parcels with travelers who are already headed in the right direction. Whether you are sending a small package across the country or traveling with extra space in your luggage, our platform makes the process simple, secure, and rewarding.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-4 mb-2">For Senders: Deliver with Ease</h3>
            <p>If you have a parcel to send, SendTins helps you find a traveler already going to your destination. You can search for available trips, view traveler profiles, compare delivery prices, and choose the option that suits your schedule and budget.</p>
            <p>Once a match is found, you can message the traveler to confirm details, complete the booking, and track your parcel in real-time through the platform. Payment is securely held and only released once delivery is confirmed — so you stay in control every step of the way. </p>

            <h3 class="heading-4 mb-2">For Travelers: Earn While You Travel</h3>
            <p>If you are planning a trip and have extra space in your bag or car, why not earn some money while helping someone out?</p>
            <p>By listing your trip on SendTins, you make it visible to potential senders looking for that exact route. Once you accept a delivery request, you’ll be connected directly with the sender to finalise the hand-off. After successful delivery, your payment is released to your account.</p>
            <p>You choose the packages you want to carry, set your own price per kilogram or parcel, and manage your availability — all from a single dashboard.</p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>1. Match</strong><br>
                    Senders post delivery requests or search for upcoming trips. Travelers list their journeys and indicate how much space they have available.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2. Connect</strong><br>
                    Once a potential match is found, both users can chat through the platform to discuss the delivery and agree on terms. You can view each other’s ratings and past reviews to build trust before committing.
                </li>
                <li><strong>3. Book</strong><br>
                    The sender confirms the delivery request and payment is processed securely. Details such as pick-up location, drop-off point, and timing are confirmed between both parties.
                </li>
                <li><strong>4. Deliver</strong><br>
                    The traveler picks up the parcel and delivers it during their scheduled trip. Once the delivery is confirmed by the recipient, the payment is released.
                </li>
