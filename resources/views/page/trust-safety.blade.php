            <p>At SendTins, trust and safety are at the core of everything we do. Whether you are sending a valuable item or carrying a package for someone else, we want every experience on our platform to feel secure, transparent, and worry-free. Our system is designed to protect both senders and travelers from profile verification to delivery confirmation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-6">
            <h3 class="heading-4 mb-2">Verified Users Only</h3>
            <p>Before anyone can send or deliver through SendTins, they must complete a profile verification process. This includes confirming identity with government-issued documents and verifying contact information. We believe that trust begins with transparency — and that starts with knowing who you are dealing with.</p>
            <p>We also encourage users to complete their profile with a photo and bio to promote community familiarity and accountability. </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="heading-4 mb-2">Secure Payment Protection</h3>
            <p>All payments on SendTins are processed through a secure escrow system. This means that funds are only released to the traveler once the parcel has been delivered and confirmed by the recipient. This protects senders from loss and ensures travelers are rewarded only after fulfilling their delivery responsibility.</p>
            <p>In case of disputes or delivery issues, our support team is here to mediate and help resolve the situation fairly.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-4 mb-4">In-App Messaging and Delivery Agreements</h3>
            <p>Senders and travelers communicate directly through our in-app messaging system. This allows both parties to clarify expectations, share delivery details, and document any agreements in writing before a booking is confirmed.</p>
            <p>Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures both parties are comfortable with the arrangement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-6">
            <h3 class="heading-4 mb-4">Community Reviews & Ratings</h3>
            <p>After each delivery, both the sender and traveler are invited to leave a review and rating. These reviews build credibility within the community and help future users make informed decisions when choosing who to work with.</p>
            <p>Consistently low ratings or repeated complaints may result in suspension or removal from the platform, helping us maintain a high standard of service and trustworthiness.</p>

        <div class="mb-6">
            <h3 class="heading-4 mb-4">Parcel & Delivery Guidelines</h3>
            <p>To keep our community safe, we have strict policies on what can and cannot be transported. Prohibited items include illegal goods, hazardous materials, weapons, and anything that violates local or international law. Users found violating these policies will be removed from the platform and may be reported to authorities.</p>
            <p>Both parties are responsible for accurately declaring the contents of the parcel. Travelers have the right to inspect the parcel before agreeing to carry it.</p>
