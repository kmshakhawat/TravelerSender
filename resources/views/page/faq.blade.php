                    SendTins is a peer-to-peer delivery platform that connects people who need to send parcels with travelers already going to that destination. Senders can find trusted travelers, and travelers can earn money by carrying safe, approved parcels along their route. Once a match is made, the delivery is booked, tracked, and confirmed through our secure platform.

Payments are protected through a secure system and only released after successful delivery. We also have built-in messaging, reviews, and a support team to help resolve any issues that may arise.

                    You can send a wide range of items, including documents, clothing, electronics, and personal items. However, prohibited items include illegal substances, weapons, perishable goods, fragile valuables, or anything restricted by local or international laws. Travelers have the right to inspect the parcel before accepting it.

                    Senders pay at the time of booking, but the payment is held securely until the parcel is successfully delivered. Once the delivery is confirmed by the sender, the funds are released to the traveler. This protects both sides and ensures fair, honest transactions.

                    Yes. Once a delivery is booked, you’ll be able to track the status of your parcel from your dashboard. You’ll also receive updates on when it’s picked up, in transit, and delivered. Communication with the traveler is also available in real-time through the built-in messaging system.

                    After each completed delivery, both the sender and traveler can leave a review and star rating. This helps build trust within the community and gives new users insight into others' reliability. Consistent high ratings boost visibility and booking opportunities.
